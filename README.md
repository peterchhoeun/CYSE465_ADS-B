#Peters Simulation homework
To run the homework simulation that i had, the files you will need are the spoofer.py and the new_get_aircraft_data.py files.
Download in a linux environment
Run the spoofer.py file in a terminal to start projecting the spoofed data
Then in another window run the get_aircraft_data.py file
after around 10 ticks youll see that the detection system starts working and detecting suspicious movement from the planes
Then to stop the simulations just click CTRL+C
