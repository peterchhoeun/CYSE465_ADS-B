# README – ADS-B Flooding Attack & Message-Rate Anomaly Defense
Author: Yevin Kariyawasam
Course: CYSE 465 – Fall 2025
Assignment: Individual Attack/Defense Implementation

## Project Overview
This repository contains my individual contribution to the team ADS-B Security Project. My assigned task was to implement one attack and one defense related to ADS-B security that differs from my teammates’ work.

I selected:
- Attack: ADS-B Flooding (Denial-of-Service style)
- Defense: Message-Rate & RSSI-Based Anomaly Detection

These scripts demonstrate how attackers can overwhelm ADS-B receivers and how message-layer validation can prevent this. The full written explanation, diagrams, and assurance case are included in my Word report.

## Repository Contents

### 1. flood_attack.py
Simulates an ADS-B flooding attack by generating high-rate ADS-B-like JSON messages.
Supports:
- Variable message rate
- Single-ICAO or multi-ICAO floods
- RSSI clustering behavior
- Output to stdout or JSONL file

### 2. rate_limit_validator.py
Implements the defense mechanism:
- Per-ICAO sliding-window rate limits
- Global message-rate anomaly detection
- RSSI clustering detection
- Outputs structured JSON alerts

This validator detects and flags the flooding attack generated by `flood_attack.py`.

## How to Run the Attack Script

Basic flood to stdout:
```
python3 flood_attack.py --rate 500 --duration 10
```

Flood into JSONL file:
```
python3 flood_attack.py --rate 800 --duration 15 --output flood.jsonl
```

Single-ICAO flood:
```
python3 flood_attack.py --fixed-icao --rate 600
```

## How to Run the Defense Script

Validate a flood JSONL file:
```
python3 rate_limit_validator.py --input flood.jsonl
```

Save alerts to separate file:
```
python3 rate_limit_validator.py --input flood.jsonl --alerts-output alerts.jsonl
```
